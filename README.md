## Naive Bayes' Classifier

This repository contains the code and data sampled from a large set of emails to create a Naive Bayesian classifier.

The comments included in the code distinguish the initial
basic naive model, the Naive Bayesian classifier, as well as the added alpha smoothing and cross validation.

The program should print the top 10 most commonly true words that predicted an email was spam.

Email data must be in format of current data for model to work so that the data may be parsed correctly.
